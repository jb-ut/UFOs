# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The webpage is working as designed, but Dana would like an update that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. She is requesting filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The new website has been updated so that users can filter by city, state, country, and shape. Users can still filter by date, as well. Users no longer need to click a button to appy the filter and can simply enter in the criteria of their search.

## Summary
One limitation of this site is the limited amount of data and that the data about the sightings is not verfied by a news source.

Reccomndation 
1. Create an API with a news source such as the Associated Press that pulls in verified sightings.
2. Create a new filter that allows users to scan for sightings reported in the news and link to the article about the sighiting.
